"""Recursive Functions â€“ Example 2- Recursive/1
Write a recursive function recursiveSumInRange that calculates the sum of all integers between a and b, inclusive, where a
and b are passed as input to the function.
Assume that the value of b is always greater than the value of a. Therefore, if a > b, it is necessary to swap the values to
ensure that a is the smaller of the two.
Then, call the function recursiveSumInRange for a = 5, b = 10 and for a = 10, b = 5.
Expected Output:
45

    if a > b:

        temp:int = a
